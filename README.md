# Doctor-Fees-Prediction

This project scrapes data from Practo to create a web application for predicting doctor fees based on user input. The web app allows users to input doctor-related features such as specialization, experience, ratings, and locality. A machine learning model, trained on the scraped data, predicts the doctor's fees based on these inputs. The application is built using Flask, a Python web framework, and includes data preprocessing, model training, and a user-friendly interface.
